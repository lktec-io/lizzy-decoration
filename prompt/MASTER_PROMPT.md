=========================================================
PROJECT
=========================================================

Project Name:

JOZZY Decoration & Accessories
Business Management System (ERP)

This is NOT a demo.

=========================================================
PROJECT GOAL
=========================================================

Build a premium ERP system with the quality of commercial software.

Well documented.

Production ready.

Every decision must prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term convenience.

Never rush.

Always think like a senior software architect before writing code.



=========================================================
SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
=========================================================

Before implementing any feature, design the system architecture.

This ERP must follow enterprise architecture principles.

The backend must NOT become a collection of random Express routes.

Use layered architecture.

Every feature must follow this flow:

Client

↓

Router

↓

Validation

↓

Authentication Middleware

↓

Authorization Middleware

↓

Controller

↓

Service

↓

Repository

↓

Database

Business logic belongs ONLY inside Services.

Database logic belongs ONLY inside Repositories.

Routes must stay thin.

Controllers should only coordinate requests.

Never place SQL queries directly inside controllers.

=========================================================
DATABASE FIRST DEVELOPMENT
=========================================================

Never start frontend first.

Never start APIs first.

Always begin with database planning.

Before creating tables:

1. Analyze relationships.

2. Design normalization.

3. Create Entity Relationship Diagram mentally.

4. Design indexes.

5. Design constraints.

6. Design foreign keys.

7. Design transactions.

Only then create migrations.

=========================================================
DATABASE STANDARDS
=========================================================

Use MySQL.

Every table must contain:

id

created_at

updated_at

created_by (where applicable)

updated_by (where applicable)

deleted_at (soft delete where appropriate)

Use:

BIGINT for IDs where scalability is important.

Proper foreign keys.

Indexes on searchable columns.

Unique constraints.

Transactions for financial operations.

Never duplicate data unnecessarily.

=========================================================
CORE DATABASE MODULES
=========================================================

Design the database before implementation.

Required modules include:

Examples:

SPR-2026-00001

SPR-2026-00002
