# JOZZY ERP — API Plan

Contract-level plan for the REST API. No route handlers are implemented yet — this defines the surface every controller/service/repository will be built against. Base path: `/api/v1`.

---

## 1. Conventions

**Response envelope** (every endpoint, success or failure):
```json
{ "success": true, "message": "string", "data": {}, "errors": [] }
```
- `errors` is populated (array of `{ field, message }`) only on validation failures.
- Stack traces and raw SQL errors are never returned — centralized error handler maps to safe messages.

**List endpoints** support these query params uniformly:
- `page`, `limit` (pagination)
- `sort` (e.g. `sort=-created_at` for descending)
- `search` (matches the resource's designated searchable columns)
- Resource-specific filters (documented per module below)

**Auth header:** `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on every protected route. Refresh token travels as an httpOnly cookie, never in the body/header.

**Every protected endpoint requires, in order:** JWT auth → permission check (`module.action` code from `permissions`) → validation → controller → service → repository. Branch-scoped resources are further filtered by the authenticated user's accessible branch(es) unless the user is Super Admin.

**Standard HTTP verbs:** `GET` (read), `POST` (create), `PUT` (full update), `PATCH` (partial update / status change), `DELETE` (soft delete).
