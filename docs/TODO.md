# JOZZY ERP — TODO

The heart of the project. Every task lives here. Checked items are never deleted, only marked complete with a date. Update this file immediately after finishing any task — never batch updates.

Legend: Priority = Critical / High / Medium / Low. Status = ☐ Not Started / ▶ In Progress / ☑ Done.

## Phase 0 — Project Setup

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | Install frontend deps: react-router-dom, axios, react-hook-form, framer-motion, react-icons, chart.js, react-chartjs-2, html5-qrcode | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Replace default `App.jsx`/`App.css`/`README.md` Vite scaffold content | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Create `src/` subfolders per `FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md` | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Scaffold `backend/` (Express app, `package.json`, folder tree) | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Install backend deps: express, mysql2, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, express-validator, helmet, express-rate-limit, cors, cookie-parser, multer, qrcode, pdfkit, exceljs, json2csv, node-cron, nodemailer, dotenv, winston | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Create `.env.example` (frontend + backend) — pure placeholders, no real secrets | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Set up MySQL connection pool + config (reads exclusively from env vars, no hardcoded fallback credentials) | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Set up base Express app: Helmet, CORS, rate limiter, JSON body parser, centralized error handler | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Set up React Router skeleton + `AuthLayout`/`MainLayout` shells | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Configure ESLint for backend (mirror frontend strictness) | High | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Write complete database schema: 10 migrations, 42 tables, FK-order statically verified + seeders (roles/permissions/expense categories/carwash services) + `schema.sql` | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Verify `npm run build` and `npm run lint` pass on frontend | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Verify backend structure without a live DB: syntax check every file, dry-import `app.js`, live health-check request on an ephemeral port | Critical | Setup | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Initialize git repository, initial commit | High | Setup | 2026-07-07 |

**Note:** production database provisioning (creating the DB/user, writing the real `backend/.env`, running the migrations, final connection test) is being handled directly by the project owner on their Contabo MySQL server — not part of this repo's automated setup.

## Phase 1 — Authentication

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | DB: `users`, `sessions`, `refresh_tokens`, `password_resets` tables + migrations | Critical | Auth | 2026-07-07 (Phase 0) |

| ☑ | Frontend: Session Expired page + auto token refresh via Axios interceptor | High | Auth | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Frontend: `AuthContext` + `ProtectedRoute` | Critical | Auth | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Business rule: block login for inactive/deleted/suspended/locked users | Critical | Auth | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Quality Check: build/lint pass, backend verified via dry-run (health/validation/auth-guard), frontend flows verified in-browser against a DB-less backend (login redirect, validation, error handling, forgot/reset/session-expired pages). Full live-DB login round-trip deferred to the project owner's environment where real MySQL credentials exist. | Critical | Auth | 2026-07-07 |

## Phase 2 — Company Settings

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | DB: `company_settings` table (single-row) | Critical | Company | 2026-07-07 (Phase 0) |
| ☑ | Backend: get/update company profile (Super Admin only, via `authorize('company.manage')`) | Critical | Company | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Backend: logo upload (Multer, type/size validation, static `/uploads` serving, old file cleanup on replace) | Critical | Company | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Company Settings page (all fields per spec, read-only for non-Super-Admins) | Critical | Company | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Wire company logo into: Sidebar, Navbar (mobile), Login page, via a shared `CompanyContext` | High | Company | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | *(Pulled forward from Phase 4, needed for "Super Admin only")*: DB-driven `authorize(permissionCode)` middleware, `permission.repository.js`, `/auth/me` now returns `permissions[]`, frontend `usePermission` hook | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-07 |
| ☑ | Quality Check: build/lint pass on both apps; backend dry-run confirms public `GET /company` reaches the DB layer (safe 500, DB-less) and `PUT /company` is correctly blocked pre-auth; frontend verified in-browser (Login page unaffected by the new `CompanyProvider`, graceful fallback to text brand mark when no company row exists yet) | Critical | Company | 2026-07-07 |

## Phase 3 — User Management

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | Backend: Users CRUD (create/edit/soft-delete) | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: activate/suspend/lock user (self-modification blocked) | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: admin-triggered password reset | High | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: assign role + branch(es) to user (`user_branches` for multi-branch managers) | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: User list (search, filter, paginate) — built on new reusable `Table`/`Pagination`/`SearchInput`/`useTable` infra, reused by every list page from here on | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: User create/edit form + avatar upload | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Validation: unique username, unique email, phone format (backend `findConflict`, express-validator) | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | *(Minimal pull-forward, read-only lookups only)*: `GET /branches` and `GET /roles` for dropdowns — full CRUD stays Phase 5/Phase 4 scope | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Quality Check: build/lint pass both apps; backend dry-run confirms `/users`, `/branches`, `/roles` all correctly 401 pre-auth; frontend verified via Playwright with mocked API responses (real components + real MainLayout shell rendering realistic data) since a live DB isn't available in this session — UserList table/badges/pagination, UserForm create, and UserForm edit (pre-filled) all screenshotted and confirmed | Critical | Users | 2026-07-08 |

## Phase 4 — Roles & Permissions

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | DB: `roles`, `permissions`, `role_permissions` tables | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-07 (Phase 0) |
| ☑ | Seed default roles: Super Administrator, Manager, Cashier, Store Keeper | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-07 (Phase 0) |
| ☑ | Seed permission catalog (view/create/edit/delete/approve/export/print + module-manage permissions) | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-07 (Phase 0) |
| ☑ | Backend: permission-check middleware (DB-driven, no hardcoding) — pulled forward to Phase 2, `middlewares/authorize.js` + `repositories/permission.repository.js` | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-07 (Phase 2) |
| ☑ | Backend: role CRUD (support future custom roles; system roles' names locked, deletion blocked if in use) | High | RBAC | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Role management + permission matrix UI (module-grouped grid, per-role diffing so only changed roles are saved, Super Administrator locked to full access) | High | RBAC | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: `usePermission` hook + permission-gated UI elements — pulled forward to Phase 2, used by `CompanySettings.jsx` | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-07 (Phase 2) |
| ☑ | Quality Check: build/lint pass both apps; backend dry-run confirms role/permission-catalog endpoints 401 pre-auth; frontend verified via Playwright with mocked API — RoleList (System/Custom badges, delete hidden for system roles), New Role modal, and PermissionMatrix (grouped checkboxes, locked Super Admin column) all screenshotted with zero console errors | Critical | RBAC | 2026-07-08 |

## Phase 5 — Branches

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | DB: `branches`, `user_branches` tables | Critical | Branches | 2026-07-07 (Phase 0) |
| ☑ | Backend: Branch CRUD, deactivate (blocked while users still assigned), assign manager | Critical | Branches | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: `utils/branchScope.js` — `getAccessibleBranchIds(user)` helper (Super Admin → `null`/unrestricted, others → their branch + `user_branches`). Built now as reusable infra; real enforcement begins once branch-owned data exists (Sales, Purchases, Inventory, Expenses in later phases) | Critical | Branches | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Branch list/create/edit pages (detail page folded into edit — matches the Users/Roles pattern, no separate read-only view built) | Critical | Branches | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Business rule: Super Admin sees all, Manager sees assigned branches, Cashier sees assigned branch only — encoded in `branchScope.js`, consumed starting Phase 14+ | Critical | Branches | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Quality Check: build/lint pass both apps (fixed on first pass — the `useTable`/`Table` pattern from Phase 3 is now well-established); backend dry-run confirms `/branches` and `/branches/active` 401 pre-auth; frontend verified via Playwright with mocked API — BranchList (active/inactive badges, resolved manager names) and BranchForm (manager dropdown) screenshotted, zero console errors | Critical | Branches | 2026-07-08 |

**Bonus (not originally scoped to this phase, done opportunistically):** converted all route-level page imports in `AppRouter.jsx` to `React.lazy()` + `Suspense` after `vite build` started warning about a >500kB chunk. Every future page follows this pattern automatically. Largest chunk dropped from 507kB to 307kB with the rest split into small per-page chunks.

## Phase 6 — Dashboard

| Status | Task | Priority | Module | Completed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ☑ | Backend: KPI aggregation endpoint — all 14 KPIs from the spec, querying the real tables built in Phase 0 (correctly returns 0 until Sales/Purchases/Inventory/etc. start writing data in later phases; no stubbing needed since the full schema already existed) | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: chart data endpoints — all 8 types (sales/revenue/expense/profit trend, top products, branch performance, inventory summary, car wash summary), `GET /dashboard/charts/:type` | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: recent activity timeline endpoint (reuses `activityLog.repository.js` from Phase 1) | High | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: global search endpoint — **users only** for now (the only searchable entity that exists); response shape is grouped by entity type so products/customers/suppliers/etc. slot in without a breaking change as their phases ship | High | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Backend: all KPIs/charts respect branch scoping via Phase 5's `branchScope.js` — first real consumer of that utility | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: KPI cards — all 14, `formatCurrency`/`formatNumber` utilities added | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Chart.js charts — all 8 types via reusable `LineChart`/`BarChart`/`DoughnutChart` wrappers themed to the brand palette | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Recent Activity timeline | High | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Quick Action buttons — all 8 from the spec, rendered visibly disabled ("coming soon") since every target page is a later phase (matches the master prompt's own Implementation Order — Dashboard is step 7, those pages are steps 8-21); each lights up automatically once its phase ships | Medium | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☐ | Frontend: Notification panel widget | High | Dashboard | *(deferred to Phase 22 — nothing generates real notifications yet; premature to build now)* |
| ☑ | Frontend: Navbar — logo, branch selector, **search now functionally wired** (debounced, dropdown results, click-outside-to-close), notifications icon (visual only, Phase 22), avatar, date/time | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Frontend: Sidebar (collapsible, active-highlight, full menu) — shipped incrementally since Phase 0, confirmed complete here | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
| ☑ | Quality Check: build/lint pass both apps (zero chunk-size warnings after Phase 5's code-splitting); backend dry-run confirms all dashboard/search endpoints 401 pre-auth; frontend verified via Playwright with mocked KPI/chart/activity/search data — full-page screenshot confirms all 14 KPI cards, all 8 charts, activity timeline, quick actions, and the wired search dropdown all render correctly with zero console errors | Critical | Dashboard | 2026-07-08 |
